🚀 RocketSim : CFD Based Rocket Flight Simulator

**Rocket-Sim** is an interactive web-based rocket flight simulator that models rocket motion using principles from **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)**, **aerodynamics**, and classical flight mechanics.

It allows users to experiment with thrust, drag, mass, and atmospheric effects to visualize real-time rocket trajectories.

# 🧠 Core Concepts Used

This simulator is not just animation — it is physics-driven.

### ✈️ Aerodynamics

* Drag force modeling
* Air density variation
* Velocity-dependent resistance
* Stability effects

### 🌊 Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)

The simulator approximates airflow interaction around the rocket body to compute drag and flow resistance.

### 🧮 Numerical Methods

Rocket motion is solved using:

**FVD — Finite Volume Discretization**

This method divides the simulation domain into small control volumes and applies conservation laws.

Used for:

* Momentum conservation
* Force balance
* Velocity updates

---

# ⚙️ Physics Model

The rocket motion is governed by:

### 1️⃣ Thrust Force

[
F_t = \dot{m} \cdot v_e
]

Where:

* ( \dot{m} ) → Mass flow rate
* ( v_e ) → Exhaust velocity

---

### 2️⃣ Drag Force

[
F_d = \tfrac{1}{2} \rho C_d A v^2
]

Where:

* ( \rho ) → Air density
* ( C_d ) → Drag coefficient
* ( A ) → Cross-sectional area
* ( v ) → Velocity

---

### 3️⃣ Net Force

[
F_{net} = F_t - F_d - mg
]

---

### 4️⃣ Acceleration

[
a = \frac{F_{net}}{m}
]

---

### 5️⃣ Position Update (FVD Time Marching)

Finite Volume time stepping:

[
v_{t+1} = v_t + a \Delta t
]
[
x_{t+1} = x_t + v \Delta t
]

* Higher altitude
* Greater drag interaction

---

### ⚖️ Mass

Rocket structural + fuel mass.

Higher mass:

* Slower acceleration
* Higher inertia
* More thrust required

---

### 🌬️ Drag Coefficient (Cd)

Represents aerodynamic efficiency.

| Shape              | Cd        |
| ------------------ | --------- |
| Streamlined rocket | 0.2 – 0.4 |
| Cylindrical body   | 0.5 – 0.8 |

Higher Cd → More air resistance.

All computed in real-time.

# 🔬 CFD & FVD Implementation Detail

Unlike simple kinematic simulators, Rocket-Sim applies:

### Control Volume Approach

Each time step treats the rocket as a moving finite volume where:

* Forces are integrated
* Momentum is conserved
* Fluxes are balanced

This allows stable numerical evolution of:

* Velocity field
* Acceleration
* Position
